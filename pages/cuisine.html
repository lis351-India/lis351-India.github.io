		<h2 class="italian"> Italian </h2>

		<p style="text-align: center;"> While I love Union and Bestia, a more recent find is Bacetti. It is located in the Los Feliz neighborhood and has a great ambience as well. My favorite dishes are the Amatriciana, my favorite pasta, and the caesar salad. I had my birthday dinner here this year and it was a crowd favorite!

		<h2 class= "japanese"> Japanese </h2>
		<img src= "../images/Kazunori.jpg" alt= "Kazunori" width= "450" height= "450" class= center>
		<p style="text-align: center;"> Next to Italian, my favorite kind of food is Japanese. I absolutely love sushi and and besides Sugarfish, my favorite restaurant is Kazunori. Kazunori and Sugarfish are owned by the same company, but Kazunori specializes in hand rolls. While the menu is limited, the quality is incredible!

		<h2 class="american"> American </h2>
		<img src="..\images\IMG_5378.jpg" alt= "In-N-Out" width= "450" height= "450" class= center>
		<p style="text-align: center;"> While I absolutely love sit down restaurants, I also love just grabbing a quick bite and taking it for the road. I have to include the most quintessential food in Los Angeles, which is In-N-Out Burger. It stands the test of time for being one of the best burgers in the country and I never get sick of it.
