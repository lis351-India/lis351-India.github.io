		<p class= "description"> My name is India Scofield. I am a fourth year political science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am very passionate about food and travel and love trying new places everywhere I go! While I have been around the world, trying new places, I think Los Angeles has some of the best restaurants in the world! This website will detail some of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles that I've been to! </p>
