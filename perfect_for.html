		<h3> Millie's Cafe </h3>
		<p> Millie's first opened in the Silver Lake neighborhood, but opened a new location in Pasadena a few years ago. I am so grateful that I don't have to travel to Silver Lake anymore to get Millie's, but the wait is almost always an hour long in Pasadena now. I would definitely recommend getting there earlier. However, the wait is always worth it. Amazing coffee and a giant selection of breakfast and lunch meals.

		<h2> Date Night </h2>
		<h3> Barra Santos </h3>
		<p> Barra Santos is a tiny portugese restaurant located in Cypress Park. I recently visited over winter break with my sister who lives in the nearby Los Feliz area. It is perfect for two people because the restaurant only has bar seating. The staff is very knowledgable about their wine list and the himachi was some of the best I have ever had! I would definitely recommend Barra Santos before going out to bars in the area. The portions are small, so plan ahead!

		<h2> Late Night Snack </h2>
		<h3> Shins Pizza </h3>
		<p> If you don't fill up from Barra Santos, dont worry because Shin's pizza is right next door! My sister and I stopped in after Barra Santos and it definitely hit the spot. Pizza is always my go to snack after a night out. Shin's had the flatbread style I love and and there was no wait!
