			<dt> <b> Villa's Tacos </b> </dt>
			<dd> - Coming from Los Angeles, my favorite type of tacos are street style. However, Villa's Tacos does a gourmet twist of the classic street style taco that you have to try! </dd>
			<dt> <b> Triple Beam Pizza </b> </dt>
			<dd> - I know that LA is not known for its pizza, but Triple Beam has some of the best pizza I've ever had. It has the perfect thin crust and I highly recommend the butternut squash! </dd>
